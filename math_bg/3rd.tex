	Coefficients of weight function as its derivatives are called secondary variables (SV).\\
	In our case, a$\frac{du}{dx}$ is secondary variable.\\
	If SV is specified in the boundary, then the conditions are called natural boundary condition (NBC).\\
	Now we convert our differential equation and boundary condition to weak form.\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Step 1\\
		   We write the weighted integral statement, i.e;\\
		   $\int_{0}^{L}$ w[-$\frac{d}{dx}$(a$\frac{du}{dx}$) - f]dx = 0\\
		   It is equivalent to differential equations and does not include any boundary conditions and thus it must be differentiable as order of differential equation.
		 \item Step 2\\
		 Weakening Differentiable of $\phi_{i}$\\
		 0= $\int_{0}^{L}$ [w[-$\frac{d}{dx}$(a$\frac{du}{dx}$)]- wf ] dx\\
		 Integrating by parts, we get,\\
		 0= $\int_{0}^{L}$[(a$\frac{dw}{dx}$$\frac{du}{dx}$) - wf] dx - [wa$\frac{du}{dx}$]\\
		 \item Step 3\\
		 Least Square Method,\\
		 $\frac{d}{dC_j}$ $\int_{0}^{L}$ $R^2$ dx=0 $\forall$ j = 1,2,...,N\\
		 This also gives N equations for N unknown coefficients.\\
		 \item Step 4\\
		 We desire that,\\
		 $\int_{0}^{L}$ $w_i(x)$ Rdx =  0 $\forall$ i=1,2,...,N\\
		 where $w_i$'s are N linearly independent functions called weight functions.\\
		 \\
		 \\
		 Substituting  $U_N$(x) in our Differential Equation,\\
		 -$\frac{d}{dx}$ [a(x)$\frac{dU_N}{dx}$] = f(x) for 0$<x<$L.\\
		 If this equally holds for all x $\in$[0,L] the solution is exact. Since, we assume it only as an approximation.\\
		 Define Residual Function as R(x,$c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$,...,$c_N$)as \\
		 R = -$\frac{d}{dx}$[a(x)$\frac{dU_N}{dx}$] - f(x)\\
		 R $\neq$0 $\forall$x  $\in$ [0, L] as a $U_N$ approximation.\\
		 Now we have various ways to minimize R in some senses over the domain.\\
		 \begin{enumerate}
		 	\item Collocation Method\\
		 	It forces that R is zero at selected N points of the domain.\\
		 	i.e; R(x, ,$c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$,...,$c_N$) = 0 $\forall$ x=$x_i$, i $\in$1,2,...,N\\
		 	Consider\\
		 	-$\frac{d}{dx}$[a(x)$\frac{du}{dx}$] = f(x) for  0$<x<$L.\\
		 	For u(x) subject to the boundary conditions\\
		 	u(0)= u_0      a(x)$\frac{du}{dx}$$\biggr$|_x$_=_L$ = $Q_L$\\
		 	where a(x) and f(x) are known functions.\\
		 	$u_0$ and $Q_L$ are known values\\
		 	In case of bar (only axial load and structure)\\
		 	u = displacement\\
		    a(x)= EA (stiffness)\\
		    f = distributed axial force\\
		    $Q_L$= axial load\\
		    Now, we want an approximation of u(x) in the form\\
		    u(x)\approx $u_N$(x) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^N $c_j$$\phi_{j}$ + (x) +$\phi_{0}$(x)
