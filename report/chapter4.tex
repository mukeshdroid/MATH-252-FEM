	Finally, We learned about the FEM, its variations and applications to various fields. We chose a truss structure and applied FEM to solve a 2D truss with straight bar elements that only undergo axial deformation. Initially we solved various examples manually and then implemented the same problems on a computer in python and verified results.We then verified results for the truss structure and were able to write a general code that would solve any other truss structures given essential parameters .Finally, we were able to visualize the initial problem along with the deformed structure. 
	
	This journey made us appreciate the logical and theoretical framework behind Finite Element analysis. Although we barely utilized a fraction of its potential, we gained experience in the basic ideas and the general approach in coding such problems in computer. We are confident that we can extend this idea in future by expanding the domain and complexity of the problems we tackle with this method.
