{\bf\color{red}In this section, the author(s) shall  summarize the main points and the results of the work. Include key facts from the background research to help explain your results as needed}.\\
	Thus, we learned about the FEM, its variations and applications to various fields. We chose a truss structure and applied FEM to solve a 2D truss with straight bar elements that only undergo axial deformation. Initially we solved various examples manually and then implemented the same problems on a computer in python and verified results.We then verified results for the truss structure and were able to write a general code that would solve any other truss structures given essential parameters .Finally, we were able to visualize the initial problem along with the deformed structure.
