     In the solution above, we have formulated the discretization of our 1D model equation using the same set of functions. The problem we came up which dealt with deformation of truss strain and truss stress was implemented in Python verifying the solution, working on the deformation of the structure using problem and solution data. For finite element formulation, obtaining the essential set of governing differential equation for which elementary matrices was needed to be evaluated applying the necessary boundary conditions to solve the linear system of equation.
