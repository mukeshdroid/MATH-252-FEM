For the purpose and verification by a concrete example and demonstration of potential application of the method, we designed a custom truss and studied its deformations under the prescribed forces . These forces and the overall structure of truss is as below.\\

Our module drew the structure of truss as

\end{figure}

Implementing the problem in python gave the following structure after deformation.\\

We also verified our solution in Frame3dd. Frame3dd is a free open-source software for static and dynamic structural analysis of 2D and 3D frames and trusses with elastic and geometric stiffness.  It is a copyright of

After verification in the software, the following structure was obtained.\\

\label{Comparision_table}
\end{table}

Table \ref{Comparision_table} shows the percentage error in each node for displacement. Going from left to right we get  displacement a as obtained in python, displacement as obtained in frame3dd and percentage error in each displacement.\\

The average percentage error in displacement is $1.73 \% $.\\
