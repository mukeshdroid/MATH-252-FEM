\section{{\bf{Result}}}

For the purpose and verification by a concrete example and demonstration of potential application of the method, we designed a custom truss and studied its deformations under the prescribed forces . These forces and the overall structure of truss is as below.\\

Implementing the problem in python gave the following structure after deformation.\\

%ss from jupyter notebook.   


We also verified our solution in Frame3dd. Frame3dd is a free open-source software for static and dynamic structural analysis of 2D and 3D frames and trusses with elastic and geometric stiffness.\\

After verification in the software, the following structure was obtained.\\

\end{table}

Table \ref{Comparision_table} shows the percentage error in each node for displacement. Going from left to right we get  displacement a as obtained in python, displacement as obtained in frame3dd and percentage error in each displacement.\\

The average percentage error in displacement is 3.76.\\
